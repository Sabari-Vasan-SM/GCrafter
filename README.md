🔧 This project is a powerful, web-based platform designed for executing and simulating G-code in real-time. It's perfect for CNC machine operators, engineers, and hobbyists to visualize, validate, and optimize their G-code programs before actual machining. The platform also supports .nc format downloads, making it easy to integrate with real CNC machines.

🌟 Key Features:

🎥 Live G-Code Simulation
✨ Real-time graphical simulation of G-code execution with visual feedback on tool paths and movements.

▶️ Run G-Code
🛠️ Execute G-code programs directly within the platform to test and review machining logic.

📤 Download Output
📝 Export simulation results and execution logs for documentation or further analysis.

📥 Download G-Code in .nc Format
📁 Conveniently download G-code in industry-standard .nc format for use on actual CNC machines.

🕒 Program History
🗂️ Automatically save and display a list of previously executed G-code files for easy access and reference.

⚙️ Settings Panel
🔧 Customize simulation parameters, display options, and execution preferences based on your CNC setup.
